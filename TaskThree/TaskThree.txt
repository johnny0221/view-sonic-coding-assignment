1. Simply describe what "function1" will do.

function1 is a generator function (also known as a saga in redux-saga) to handle a side effect, It does the following work
1. creates two variables initially, an AbortController for aborting the request and POST request config
2. First, it executes a call effect in redux-saga for performing the POST request, since the call effect is a blocking effect, we will have to wait the request to be finished before executing the next line
3. If the request succeed, execute a put effect, it will be caught by the redux-saga middleware for dispatching an success action
4. If the request failed, execute another put effect, it will be caught by the redux-saga middleware for dispatching an failure action
5. Execute another put effect in the final block if the user aborts the signal

However, since the call effect is a blocking effect, we may not be able to abort it during the request.

2. Can we stop what "function1" is doing? How?

We can leverage the fork effect and cancel effect to stop function1's ongoing request, unlike call effect the fork effect brings a non-blocking behavior and the cancel effect provides a signal to cancel the request

below are the brief description of how we can achieve stopping function1's request

1. First, create a function1Watcher generator listenting to the action to trigger function1
2. Second, leverage the fork effect to execute function1 for non-blocking behavior, then use the take effect to listen any ABORT_FUNCTION1 action
3. We will execute a cancel effect when we receive the ABORT_FUNCTION1 action
4. If fork effect is ongoing, The block of code in the finally block inside function1 will be executed to abort the request when receiving the ABORT_FUNCTION1
5. If fork effect is finished, will do nothing

The implementation of the above description will be in the third question

3. How to optimize this snippet?

function* function1(action) {
    const ctrl = new AbortController();
    const config = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'https://some-endpoint-url.com',
        data: action.payload,
        signal: ctrl.signal,
    };
    try {
        const { data } = yield call(/** a axios request with config */);

        yield put(/** reducer 1 */);
    } catch(e) {
       if (e.response) {
         const er = e.response;

         yield put(/** reducer 2 */);

         return;
       }
    } finally {
        // leverage the cancelled effect for handling task cancellation
        if (yield cancelled()) {
            ctrl.abort()
            yield put(/** reducer 3 */);
        }
    }
}

function* function1Watcher() {
    // continuously watch the saga
    while(true) {
       const {function1Args} = yield take('FUNCTION1_ACTION')
       const function1Task = yield fork(function1, function1Args)
       const action = yield take('ABORT_FUNCTION1')
       if (action.type === 'ABORT_FUNCTION1') {
         yield cancel(function1Task)
       }
    }
}

function* function2() {
    // perform a put effect here for easier unit testing since it returns an js object
    yield put({ type: 'ABORT_FUNCTION1' })
}
